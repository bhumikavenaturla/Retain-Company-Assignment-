I'm Gouda Akhil, and I completed this URL Shortener assignment on my own with help from ChatGPT as a tool.

## Tools I Used

**ChatGPT**:  
  I used it to guide me in building the Flask app, fixing bugs, generating short codes, and writing test cases.

**PowerShell & curl.exe**:  
  I used these to test my API from the command line.

## What I Used ChatGPT For

- Helped me write and correct route functions
- Suggested how to handle invalid URLs and generate short codes
- Helped me write test files and fix curl errors in PowerShell
- Explained error messages and how to run Flask properly

I followed all the instructions in the README file. My app works perfectly at `http://localhost:5000` and passes test cases.
